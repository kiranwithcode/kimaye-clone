# Kimaye – Project Work
Unit-4 Construct Week Project

### Description
From being the largest exporter of pomegranates and bananas to stepping into the domestic retail market, we've come a long way by adding more colours to your plate.
We work with the farmers from the time they plant the seed. Our fruits meet international safety standards at every stage of growing, sourcing, packaging, and delivery. We've worked with farmers and innovated farming and delivery techniques for better shelf life and traceability while meeting the most stringent safety norms.

Our accolades are only a part of our journey. It's our mantra — safest fruits, always — that we wear as a badge of honour.
